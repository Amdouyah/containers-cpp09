# containers-cpp09

This repository contains projects that focus on implementing **templated containers**, **iterators**, and **algorithms** in C++. It is designed to deepen the understanding of key C++ concepts and the construction of fundamental components of the Standard Template Library (STL).

## Modules Overview

1. **Templated Containers**  
   Learn how to design and implement generic containers, such as vectors, stacks, and lists, which can store various types of data using C++ templates.

2. **Iterators**  
   Implement and use custom iterators to traverse through elements of containers in a consistent manner, regardless of the underlying container type.

3. **Algorithms**  
   Develop and apply algorithms like searching, sorting, and transforming data within custom containers.

## Features

- Custom **templated containers**: Implement data structures that can hold any type of data using templates.
- **Iterators** for custom containers: Enable efficient traversal of container elements.
- Implement **standard algorithms**: Algorithms such as searching, sorting, and data transformations for containers.
